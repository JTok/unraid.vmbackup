kill_vm_if_cant_shutdown="no_config"

inline_zstd_compress="no_config"

# default is 0. set this to 1 if you would like to compress backups. This can add a significant amount of time to the backup process. uses tar.gz for sparse file compatibility.

zstd_threads="no_config"

# default is 6. choose the compression level for pigz to use. set to 1 for the lowest compression level, but the highest speed, and 9 is the highest compression level, but the lowest speed.
# this is the legacy setting for compression.
pigz_level="no_config"

# default is 2. choose the number of threads for pigz to use. set to 0 to let pigz automatically choose the number of online processors.
# this is the legacy setting for compression.

# default is 1. set to 0 if you would like to skip backing up nvram files.

# NOTE: rsync was significantly slower in my tests.
